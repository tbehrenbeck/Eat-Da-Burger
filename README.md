# Shopping Cart

This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and elements from the Bootstrap framework and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may add any item to their 'shopping cart'. This also adds the entry into the MySQL database. The item initially is added to the 'To Buy' category. The user may then indicate they've 'Bought' the item by clicking on the designated button, which moves it into the 'Bought' category and updates its status accordingly in the database.
